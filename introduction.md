ABOUT GAME:
Flying bug is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bug, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating the bug through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights.

This is our first project so we are completely new to GITHUB . So we might have skipped some parts to show the contributions of individual members. 
We have made this game in our own pcs and then uploaded the complete file in github. 

Individual Contributions : 
kesav -mainGame()
Sanyam -welcomeScreen()
Shyam -isCollide()
Akshit-getRandomPipe()


welcomeScreen()- Shows welcome images on the screen 
mainGame()- it is responsible for complete movement of objects in the game. 
isCollide()-this function comes into act when the bug collides. 
getRandomPipe()- this function generates positions of two pipes (one bottom straight and one top rotated) for blitting on the screen .
